#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Honeypots are systems used to both detect the presence of an intruder attempting to breach a network or system, monitor the intruder's behavior, and divert the intruder from other targets. This OpenC2 Actuator Profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of command and control of various honeypots across one or more networks.

# 1 Introduction

The text in this section may all be replaced, but the following three sections (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are required for OASIS publications. Section 1.1 (IPR Policy) must not be changed by the TC. Section 1.2 (Terminology) may be modified to include other terminology-related information used in this specification. Section 1.3 (Normative References) should be modified to include additional references, as needed. Section 1.4 (Non-Normative References) is not required, but should be modified to include additional references, as needed.

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o ap-sbom-v1.0-wd01.html --metadata title="Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Profile for Software Bill of Materials Retrieval Version 1.0"

We are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.

## 1.5 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when the HTML is generated.
Even if the text appears to be separate lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters (or space-backslash) to the end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph tag  
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.5.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE:
<note caption is best placed ABOVE figure, to allow a link to it to display image - same for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this image is missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.5.2 Tables

#### 1.5.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.5.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.5.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption:
Please see [Table 1-5 or other meaningful label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction) 


### 1.5.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

Left-justified list without bullets or numbers:
To list multiple items without full paragraph breaks between items, add space-backslash after each item except the last.

### 1.5.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6 headings like: `###### [RFC2119]`
###### [RFC2119]
Bradner, S., "Key words ..."

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like: `see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]`  
"see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:  
-- punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )  
-- leading white spaces will be dropped  
-- upper case will be converted to lower  
-- spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to cross-references and to section headings.  
-- Thus, a section heading like "## 1.3 Normative References"  
-- becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#13-normative-references">`  
-- referenced in the markdown like: see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references)  
-- (in markdown: `"see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references"`)  
-- similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.5.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code block).

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML format. If it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single "backtick" character: 
`code text`

## 1.6 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the PDF - before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" - which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding

_This section is normative_

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments that are meaningful in the context of Honeypots. This section also describes the appropriate format for the status and properties of a Response frame. This section is organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands.

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.5, where:

1. The unique name of the SLPF schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-honeypots`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the SLPF schema is:  `honeypots`
3. The definitions of and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of Honeypots.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of Honeypots.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10)
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of Honeypots
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of Honeypots and one Target (and its associated Specifier) that is defined in this specification
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in the Language Specification and a set of Arguments defined in this specification
* Actuator:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of Honeypots

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 Actions defined in version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of Honeypots. The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

| 20 | **delete** | Remove an entity (e.g., data, files, flows). Used to remove one or more honeypots |

### 2.1.2 Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 summarizes the Targets defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to Honeypots functionality. Table 2.1.2-2 summarizes the Targets that are defined in this specification.

#### 2.1.2.1 Common Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 lists the Targets defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are applicable to Honeypots. The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

### 2.1.4 Actuator Specifiers
An Actuator is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the Action. The Actuator executes the Action on the Target. In the context of this profile, the Actuator is the Honeypots and the presence of one or more Specifiers further refine which Actuator(s) shall execute the Action.

Table 2.1.4-1 lists the Specifiers that are applicable to the Honeypots Actuator. [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands) provides sample Commands with the use of Specifiers.

The Actuator Specifiers defined in this document are referenced under the honeypots namespace.

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

An OpenC2 Command consists of an Action/Target pair and associated Specifiers and Arguments. This section enumerates the allowed Commands and presents the associated Responses.

Table 2.3-1 defines the Commands that are valid in the context of the SLPF profile. An Action (the top row in Table 2.3-1) paired with a Target (the first column in Table 2.3-1) defines a valid Command. The subsequent subsections provide the property tables applicable to each OpenC2 Command.

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

|   | Query | Start | Stop | Restart | Set | Update | Create | Delete |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **devices** | | valid | valid | valid |   | valid | valid | valid |
| **features** | valid | |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| **files** |  |  |   |   | valid | valid |   |   |
| **hit_count** | valid |  |   |   | |  |   |   |
| **hit_details** | valid |  |   |   | |  |   |   |

Table 2.3-2 defines the Command Arguments that are allowed for a particular Command by the SLPF profile. A Command (the top row in Table 2.3-2) paired with an Argument (the first column in Table 2.3-2) defines an allowable combination. The subsection identified at the intersection of the Command/Argument provides details applicable to each Command as influenced by the Argument.

**Table 2.3-2. Command Arguments Matrix**

### 2.3.1 Allow
Table 2.3.1-1 summarizes the Command Arguments that apply to all of the Commands consisting of the 'allow' Action and a valid Target type.

Upon receipt of an unsupported Command Argument, SLPF Consumers

* MUST NOT respond with a OK/200
* SHOULD respond with the 501 status code.
* SHOULD respond with "Option not supported" in the status text
* MAY respond with the 500 status code

OpenC2 Producers that send 'allow target' Commands and support the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:

* MUST support the slpf:rule_number Target type as defined in [Section 2.1.2.2](#2122-slpf-targets)
* SHOULD populate the Command Arguments field with "response_requested" : "complete"
* MAY populate the Command Arguments field with the "insert_rule" : <integer> option
* MUST populate the Command Arguments field with "response_requested" : "complete" if the insert_rule Argument is populated

OpenC2 Consumers that receive and successfully parse 'allow <target>' Commands but cannot implement the 'allow <target>' :

* MUST NOT respond with a OK/200
* SHOULD respond with the 501 status code
* SHOULD respond with 'Rule not updated' in the status text
* MAY respond with the 500 status code

OpenC2 Consumers that receive 'allow <target>' Commands and support the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:

* MUST support the slpf:rule_number Target type as defined in [Section 2.1.2.2](#2122-slpf-targets)
* Upon successful implementation of the 'allow <target>', MUST return the rule_number associated with the rule if the "response_requested" : "complete" option is populated.

OpenC2 Consumers that receive 'allow target' Commands and support the 'insert_rule' Command Argument:

* MUST assign the rule number provided if the "insert_rule" : <integer> option is populated.
* If the rule number is currently in use, then
    * MUST NOT respond with a OK/200.
    * SHOULD respond with the 501 status code.
    * SHOULD respond with 'Rule number currently in use' in the status text.
    * MAY respond with the 500 status code.

The valid Target types, associated Specifiers, and Options are summarized in [Section 2.3.1.1](#2311-allow-ipv4_connection) and [Section 2.3.1.2](#2312-allow-ipv6_connection). Sample Commands are presented in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

The 'allow ipv4_connection' Command is OPTIONAL for Openc2 Producers implementing the SLPF.
The 'allow ipv4_connection' Command is OPTIONAL for Openc2 Consumers implementing the SLPF.

The Command permits traffic that is consistent with the specified ipv4_connection. A valid 'allow ipv4_connection' Command has at least one property of the ipv4_connection populated and may have any combination of the five properties populated. An unpopulated property within the ipv4_connection Target MUST be treated as an 'any'.

Products that receive but do not implement the 'allow ipv4_connection' Command:

* MUST NOT respond with a OK/200

The 'allow ipv4_net' Command is OPTIONAL for Openc2 Consumers implementing the SLPF.

The Command permits traffic as specified by the range of IPv4 addresses as expressed by CIDR notation. If the mask is absent (or unspecified) then it MUST be treated as a single IPv4 address (i.e., an address range of one element). The address range specified in the ipv4_net MUST be treated as a source OR destination address.

Products that receive but do not implement the 'allow ipv4_net' Command:
* MUST NOT respond with a OK/200
* SHOULD respond with the 501 Response code
* SHOULD respond with 'Target type not supported' in the status text

### 2.3.2 Deny
'Deny' can be treated as the mathematical complement to 'allow'. With the exception of the additional 'drop_process' Actuator-Argument, the Targets, Specifiers, Options and corresponding Responses are identical to the four 'allow' Commands. Table 2.3-2 summarizes the Command Arguments that apply to all of the Commands consisting of the 'deny' Action and valid Target type.

Upon receipt of a Command with an Argument that is not supported by the Actuator:

* MUST NOT respond with OK/200
* SHOULD respond with the 501 status code
* SHOULD respond with 'Option not supported' in the status text
* MAY respond with the 500 status code

OpenC2 Producers that send 'deny target' Commands and support the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:

#### 2.3.3.1 Query features
The 'query features' Command MUST be implemented in accordance with Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10).

### 2.3.4 Delete
The slpf:rule_number is the only valid Target type for the delete Action. The associated Specifiers, and Options are summarized in [Section 2.3.4.1](#2341-delete-slpfrule_number). Sample Commands are presented in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

#### 2.3.4.1 delete slpf:rule_number

Implementation of the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command is OPTIONAL. Products that choose to implement the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command MUST implement the slpf:rule_number Target type described in [Section 2.1.2.2](#2122-slpf-targets).

OpenC2 Producers that send the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:

* MAY populate the Command Arguments field with 'response_requested" : "complete"
* MUST NOT include other Command Arguments
* MUST include exactly one rule_number

OpenC2 Consumers that receive the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:

* but cannot parse or process the 'delete slpf:rule_number' Command:
    * MUST NOT respond with a OK/200
    * SHOULD respond with status code 400
    * MAY respond with the 500 status code
* but do not support the slpf:rule_number Target type:

    * SHOULD respond with 'firewall rule not removed or updated' in the status text

Refer to [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands) for sample Commands.

### 2.3.5 Update
The 'file' Target as defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification is the only valid Target type for the update Action. The associated Specifiers, and Options are summarized in [Section 2.3.5.1](#2351-update-file). Sample Commands are presented in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-Commands).

#### 2.3.5.1 Update file
The 'update file' Command is used to replace or update files such as configuration files, rule sets, etc. Implementation of the update file Command is OPTIONAL. OpenC2 Consumers that choose to implement the 'update file' Command MUST include all steps that are required for the update file procedure such as retrieving the file(s), install the file(s), restart/ reboot the device etc. The end state shall be that the firewall operates with the new file at the conclusion of the 'update file' Command. The atomic steps that take place are implementation specific.

Table 2.3-2 presents the valid options for the 'update file' Command. OpenC2 Producers and Consumers that choose to implement the 'update file' Command MUST NOT include options other than the options identified in Table 2.3-2.

OpenC2 Producers that send the 'update file' Command:

* MAY populate the arguments field with the "response_requested" argument. Valid values for "response_requested" for 'update file' are "complete", "ack", and "none"

# 3 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# 4 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
